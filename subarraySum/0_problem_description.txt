Write an algorithm that gets as input:

1.an unsorted array of non-negative integers - A
2.a non-negative integer - s

and return as output two indeces i and j that represents the start and end of 
a continous subarray of A which adds to s.

if there's no such subarray then the algorithm returns NIL
