Let A={a_1, a_2, ..., a_n} be a sequence of non-negative integers.
Let s be a non-negative integer.

if s=0 than the only possibility to have a subarray that add to s is if 
we have some a_i in A such that a_i = 0

so we can just iterate A and look for an element that equals to zero.

else , we assume that s is greater than zero.

Because we're dealing with continuous elements, we may need to know our borders,
where the subsequence start and where it ends.
The most natural place to start accumulate elements in this case is from the first element.
So the procedure will look something like this(assuming we initialize some variables that later will be discuusded)
	start from the first element in A.
	accumulate elements in A to the right and add them, do this until the result you got is not less than s.
	at any point, if you add elements and the result you get is greater than s 
	then you need to subtract from that result the previous elements you added in a natural order,that means,
	from the first element to the left of the elements you've accumulated.
	
	if the result is equal to s then we're done
	the left border and right border of the accumulated elements is the result.
	
	if we reached to the last element of the sequence and sum < s, you should notice that there's no need to continue 
	since from here we can only subtract elements and this will not benefit us in that case because sum will get smaller at each 		subtraction.
