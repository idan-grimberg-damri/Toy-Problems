the first nested loop we accumulate elements to the right , starting from the right border (named "end").
The sceond nested loop we accumulate elements the the right, starting from the left border (named "start").
At the worst case, each element we added at iteration i, we need to subtract at iteration i+1.
(*) We can conclude that we visit an element two times at the wrost case.    
Let n be the size of the sequence.
each nested loop at the worst case runs at O(n) time.
From here and (*) we get at the wrost case time of O(2n)= O(n)
