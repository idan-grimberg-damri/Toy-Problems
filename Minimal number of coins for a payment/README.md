Show an algorithm that takes as input:

1. A nonnegative integer X that represents an amount to pay

2. A sequence Cn=c1,c2,...,cn of unique positive integers  s.t each integer represents a coin

and returns the smallest number of coins with which you can pay the amount of X.

Two cases can be distinguished:

Case1: all coins are multiple of one another(I didn't show this completely since it's the easy case, I just explained how to solve this.
Case2: not all coins are multiple of one another.
